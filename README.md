# Tables of Iwasawa Invariants for Supersingular Primes

This repository contains code and data for computing tables of Iwasawa invariants for supersingular primes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to compute and display tables of Iwasawa invariants for supersingular primes. The primary computations are performed by a Jupyter Notebook, and the resulting tables are saved as CSV files.

## Code

- **Main Notebook:**  
  The code is located at:  
  `Pollack_tables/plus_minus/Rank_1_points.ipynb`  
  This notebook is designed to be run from start to finish, performing all necessary computations and generating the tables.

## Data

- **CSV Files:**  
  The computed tables are saved as CSV files in this repository. These files contain the output from the computations performed in the notebook.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
